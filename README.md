# MaskedEditText

It allows you to add a mask to EditText

![GIF of its use](https://github.com/Luucasdornelas/MaskedEditText/blob/master/resources/masked_edit_text.gif)

# Version

2.0.4

# Installation

To use this library in your android project, just simply add the following dependency into your build.gradle

```sh
dependencies {
    compile 'com.luucasdornelas:MaskedEditText:2.0.4'
}
```

# Usage

Just add in xml custom MaskedEditText with attribute app:mask="your_mask" like below:

```xml
<masktext.MaskedEditText
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:mask="your_mask" />
```
Or add TextChangedListener for your EditText like in following code:

```java
MaskedFormatter formatter = new MaskedFormatter("your_mask");
mEditText.addTextChangedListener(new MaskedWatcher(formatter, mEditText));
```
Object of MaskedWatcher class has got a weakreference to formatter object, so you must to conside this.
 
**For create your mask you need to use following keys:**
```
ANYTHING KEY = *;
DIGIT KEY = #;
UPPERCASE KEY = U;
LOWERCASE KEY = L;
ALPHA NUMERIC KEY = A;
CHARACTER KEY = ?;
HEX KEY = H;
```

For example: you would like create a mask for a mobile number in format **(029)777-77-77**. Just use the simple mask **"(###)###-##-##"**.

**If you want to get text without mask just use following code:**
 - For getting unmasked text for **MaskedEditText mEdtMaskedCustom** just use
 
    ```java
    String unamskedString = mEdtMaskedCustom.getUnMaskedString();
    ```
 - For getting unmasked text for default EditText just use
 
    ```java
    String text = mEditText.getText().toString();
    String unmaskedString = formatter.formatString(text).getUnMaskedString();
    ```
